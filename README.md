# TSGL-EEGConv

This is the Repository of TSGL-EEGNet. TSGL-EEGNet is a kind of Convolutional Network for pre-processed EEG signals to predict classes. TSGL-EEGNet is based on EEGNet which you can find it [here](https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels). 

## Dataset

- [BCI Competition IV 2a](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#dataset2a)

You need to do some pre-processing works before using it. Maybe you need MATLAB and EEGlab tools to read these datas and transform them to *.mat file format.

## Features

# Framework for EEG

- Cross Validation Framework
- Grid Search Framework
- Cropped Training with CV and GS
- Visualization Framework
