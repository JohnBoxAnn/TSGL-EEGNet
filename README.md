# TSGL-EEGConv

This is the Repository of TSGL-EEGNet. TSGL-EEGNet is a kind of Convolutional Network for pre-processed EEG signals to predict classes. TSGL-EEGNet is based on EEGNet which you can find it [here](https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels). 

## Dataset

- [BCI Competition IV 2a](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#dataset2a)

You need to do some pre-processing works before using it. Maybe you need MATLAB and EEGlab tools to read these datas and transform them to *.mat file format.

## Features

### Framework for EEG

- Cross Validation Framework
- Grid Search Framework
- Cropped Training with CV and GS
- Visualization Framework

### Implemented Models

- EEGNet [[1]](http://stacks.iop.org/1741-2552/15/i=5/a=056013)
- TSGL-EEGNet
- DeepConvNet [[2]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23730)
- ShallowConvNet [[2]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23730)
- ~~Multi-branch 3D CNN [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8820089)~~ Not supported yet.
- [FBCSP](https://github.com/TNTLFreiburg/fbcsp)

### Upgrade Log

- v1.1
  - use a new code construction to do cropped training
  - use generator to train on a large dataset
  - rename core.train to core.training, to be different from .train
  - add maxmin normalization
  - separate code test and model test
  - fix some bugs
- known issues
  - cv testing and model ensemble (stacking) are not adapted
- next
  - use generator to load a large dataset
